### Local development

* Python 3
* PyEnv or VirtualEnv
* [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
* [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

Setup your virtual environment using the tool of your choice, e.g. VirtualEnv:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the build tools:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now build the Rust module and include opt-in additional dev dependencies:

```shell
maturin dev -E test,lint
```

You usually need to build the Rust module only once, but you might need to rebuild it on pulls.

For linting and testing:

```shell
just verify
```

## Releasing the package

Pull latest main:

```shell
git checkout main && git pull
```

**Update module version in `Cargo.toml` and run a local build to update the `Cargo.lock` too**, commit it. Then push tag, e.g.:

```
git tag -m "Release v0.1.0" v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```
